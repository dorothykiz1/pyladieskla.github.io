Well well well, Dorothy Kabarozi is my name.Apparently am not engaged with work apart from running around the household with my Two-year-old.I graduated sometime back with a bachelor's  in Software Engineering and its recently when I had dropped by to out box Hub that I landed on a one Solomon who helped me sign up to the on-line meet-up group that could always keep me updated on upcoming events. On the group I learnt that there was a Women Take makers event that I was dying for to attend and I finally did.

The most interesting part that's exactly when i met Joannah,a guest speaker who really, really, really motivated me on how she started with code n how she seemed happy with what she does .Also in her speech she talked about how she encourages women to learn code and that she was organising 2 events at the time(Rails girls and Pyladies Kampala).
Cut the long story short I signed up and showed up for the first day of the Pyladies Kampala sprint.For some reason i came in late but God was on my side i had missed only the introductory part(where you all introduce yourselves and all ).I found my way to an empty seat that had Winnie (my new friend at the time)and well she made me comfortable and all the girls seemed friendly and the coaches too so it was so easy to fit in. The first day was so interesting,even though I had some little knowledge on GIT , Leni really helped me learn Git and i left feeling like a Git Guru and shE also talked about Open Source projects and on how to contribute to them.

Since I had applied for Rails Girls Summer of Code,i felt i was in the right place because I really needed to learn more about Open Source Projects.So second day comes and they pair us and I was in the group Awesome Coders with my Team mate Lydia.
We initially opted for Pyladies project first but we later changed our minds to Coala since **the logo had some bears** (I mean like Teddy bears) and that alone was catchy.
So on that day, we forked and cloned the Coala repository and began to read through some instructions too.We managed to identify an issue and that was to Add git commit to Newcomers guide .The most interesting part was claiming the issue and then the project maintainer responded instantly in a positive way, it was en lighting, you should have seen my face after that..i was beaming..

We were able to join the coala development group and we were assigned the issue and on the third day of the sprint, my team mate managed to make a pull request and it was really rewarding and exciting.So on the final day of the sprint ,I learnt that I needed to get another issue to work on since only one person could only work on an issue and that my Team mate had made a pull request already on the first issue we had identified.Gladly I was able to get another issue too i.e..Add a command pytest to the guide which I did successfully and i was able to make a pull request too.See attached link https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5411
I received reviews and am still working on them up to now.

All in all ,its at Pyladies Kampala that I felt confident that I could contribute to real life projects as long as they are open source.I learnt that there are always people willing to 
help like in the Coala community and all willing to guide you.It also felt good to work in a team and help each other to finish the assigned tasks.Lastly even if i didnt make it to 
Rails girls summer of code,I feel confident enough that when I apply next time am ready to attack the tasks and execute since Pyladies Kampala taught me what to do.THANK YOU.
